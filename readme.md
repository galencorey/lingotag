Lingotag is a mobile language learning application that allows users to learn from the world around them. Users take a photo of an object, and see relevant tags for that object in the target language of their choosing. Users can study these tags in the moment, or save them and generate a flash card deck that is based off of everyday things that they have encountered in real life.
